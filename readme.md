# K40

## Specs

40W CO2 laser with 10600nm wavelength.

## Safety

### Laser Goggles

K40 uses a laser with the wavelength of 10600nm. This kind of range should be covered by OD7+ according
to the Internet.

I found OD4s which have the range of 5000-11000nm and are meant for CO2 lasers. I asked the retailer if
these will suffice and why I don't need OD7+ if they'll say these will do. The OD (optical density) value
is about how much light is kept out (99 % OD1, 99.9 % OD2, 99.99 % OD3, etcâ€¦) so I guess from some base
safe OD value, the increasing OD value becomes about for how long the eye is protected in an event of a
direct impact, but that's only a guess at this point.

### CO2 & CO Fumes

K40 uses a CO2 laser and in case of a malfunction, it might release dangerous CO2 fumes. CO2 is not the
same thing as CO so it's important to buy the right kind of a detector! Most people who have some kind of
a detector already will have a CO detector, CO2 detectors are more expensive and harder to come by. I
found one which should work for the K40:

K40 will also emit CO fumes in case wood it being engraved or cut. In case of other materials, various
other kinds of fumes might be let out of the machine. It's not a terrible idea to get a CO detector in
addition to the CO2 detector as it could detect improper ventilation of the wood burn fumes or a fire
starting to develop in case the material being worked on catches fire. I already use a CO detector at
home and will probably get the same one for the shop, too:

### Electrical Grounding

Ground the laser chassi so that in case of an electrical discharge through insufficient insulation, the
machine doesn't discharger into you, the operator. It uses high value (even though with low current, but
the current is direct - DC) and getting zapped by it could induce a cardiac arrest and kill you.

### Fire Hazard

Do not leave the laser cutter unsupervised as the material being engraved or cut could catch fire which
could spread.

### Safety Improvements

It is a good idea to wire an endstop switch to the lid of the laser cutter in case the lid gets open
while the laser operates.

## Maintenance

Never run the laser cutter without the water pump connected and fully submerged in distilled water as
it could significantly shorten the lifespan of the laser tube.
